00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.030
Let's try to learn a thing or two about ratios.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.020
So ratios are just expressions that compare quantities.

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.080
So that might just be a fancy way-- let me just --of saying

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.820
something that you may or may not understand.

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.000
So let me give you actual examples.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.030
If I have ten horses and I have five dogs.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:36.060
And someone were to come to me and say Sal, what is the ratio is of horses to dogs?

8
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.420
So I want to know how many horses do I have for some number of dogs.

9
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.770
So I could say I have ten horses for every five dogs.

10
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.040
So I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is ten:five.

11
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.410
Or I could also write that as a fraction.

12
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.070
I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is ten / five.

13
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.770
Or I could just write it out. I could say it is ten to five.

14
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.000
These all are saying the same thing.

15
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.060
The thing I write first, or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses.

16
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.850
So this is the number of horses right there,

17
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.010
that's the number of horses, or that's the number of horses.

18
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.670
If I wanted to talk about the number of dogs, this is the number of dogs,

19
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.320
that's the number of dogs, or that's the number of dogs.

20
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.010
I'm just-- These are all just expressions that are comparing two quantities.

21
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.350
Now, I just said I have ten horses for every five dogs.

22
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:43.000
But what does that mean? That means I have two horses for every one dog.

23
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.970
If for 5 dogs I have 10,

24
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.020
that means that for every 1 of these dogs, there are 2 horses.

25
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.380
For every one of-- every two of these horses, there's one dog.

26
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.520
I just kind of reasoned through that.

27
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.620
So this is-- I have two horses for every one dog.

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.040
But how do you get there? How do you get from ten:five to two:one?

29
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.000
Well you can think of what's the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers?

30
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.030
What's their greatest common divisor? I have a whole video on that.

31
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.360
The biggest number that divides into both of these guys is five.

32
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.010
So you divide both of them by 5 and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form.

33
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.000
And if I write it here, it would be the same thing as two / one or two to one.

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.570
And so what's interesting about ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't

35
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.010
always have to be literally, the number of horses and the numbers of dogs you have.

36
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.380
What a ratio tells you is how many horses do I have for every dog.

37
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.470
Or how many dogs do I have for every horse.

38
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.760
Now, just to make things clear,

39
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:58.500
what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses?

40
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.700
So what's the difference in these two statements?

41
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.000
Here I said horses to dogs.

42
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.110
Here I'm saying dogs to horses.

43
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.030
So, since I've switched the ratio-- What I'm looking for--

44
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.910
I'm looking for the ratio of dogs to horses, I switch the numbers.

45
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.000
So dogs-- For every five dogs, I have ten horses.

46
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.840
Or if I divide both of these by five, for every one dog, I have five horses.

47
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.000
So the ratio of dogs to horses is five:ten or one:five.

48
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.080
Or you could write it this way. one to-- I can write it-- Let me write it down here.

49
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.510
one / five. Or I could write one to five.

50
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.360
And the general convention-- This wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong.

51
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.560
But the general convention is to get your ratio or your fraction,

52
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.030
if you want to call it that, into the simplest form or into this reduced form right there.

53
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.080
Let's just do a couple of other examples.

54
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:12.350
Let's say I have twenty apples. Let's say I have forty oranges.

55
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:24.450
And let's say that I have sixty strawberries.

56
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.740
Now what is the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this.

57
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:48.320
I could write what is the ratio of apples:oranges:strawberries?

58
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:55.760
Well I can start off by literally saying, well for every sixty strawberries

59
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.050
I have forty oranges and I have twenty apples.

60
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.600
And this would be legitimate.

61
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.550
You could say the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries are twenty:forty:sixty.

62
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.430
And that wouldn't be wrong. But we saw before, we could put into reduced form.

63
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.590
So we think of what's the largest number that divides into all three of these?

64
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.010
We can't just do it into 2 of these now because now my ratio has 3 actual quantities.

65
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.870
Well the largest number that divides into all of these guys is twenty.

66
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:35.290
If we divide all of them by twenty, we can then say for every one apple,

67
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.290
I now have-- you divide this guy by twenty --I have two oranges,

68
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.610
and I have three strawberries.

69
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.710
So the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is one:two:three.

70
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.470
And I got that, in every case, by just dividing these guys all by twenty.

71
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.250
I divided by twenty. I think you get the general idea.

72
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.020
Let me just write it down because it never hurts to have a little bit more clarification.

73
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.520
If someone wanted to know the ratio of strawberries to oranges--

74
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.000
Let me get into my orange color.

75
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.910
Strawberries to oranges to apples.

76
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.690
I thought I was going to do that in yellow. To apples.

77
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.580
What is this ratio going to be?

78
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:31.050
Well for every three strawberries, I have two oranges and I have one apple.

79
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.000
So then it would be three:two:one.

80
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.830
The general idea is whatever order someone asks you for the different items,

81
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.030
you put-- the ratio is going to be in that same exact order.

82
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:46.980
Now, in all of the examples so far I gave you the number of quantity--

83
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.010
the quantity of things we had and I-- we figured out the ratio.

84
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:56.360
What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio?

85
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:12.780
What if I said the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is two / three.

86
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.010
Which I could've also written as two:three just like that.

87
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:23.010
So for every two boys, I have three girls or for every three girls, I have two boys.

88
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:37.300
And let's say that there are forty students in the classroom.

89
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:50.030
And then someone were to ask you how many girls are in the classroom?

90
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.300
So this seems a little bit more convoluted than what we did before.

91
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.590
We know the total number of students and we know the ratio.

92
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.430
But how many girls are in the room? So let's think about it this way.

93
00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.720
The fact that the ratio of boys to girls-- I'll write it like this.

94
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.420
Boys-- Maybe I'll be stereotypical with the colors.

95
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:14.290
The ratio of boys to girls is equal to two:three.

96
00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:19.010
Hate to be so stereotypical, but it doesn't hurt. two:three.

97
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.920
The ratio of boys to girls is two:three.

98
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.760
So this stands for every three girls, there's two boys.

99
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.000
For every two boys, there's three girls. But what does it also say?

100
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:39.040
It also says for every five students, there are what?

101
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:49.990
There are two boys and three girls.

102
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:53.070
Now why is this statement helpful?

103
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.050
Well how many groups of five students do I have?

104
00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:04.020
I have forty students in my class right there, right?

105
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.660
And for every five students, there are two boys and three girls.

106
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:11.030
So how many groups of five students do I have?

107
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.730
So I have a total of forty students.

108
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.040
Let me do it in this purple color.

109
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:28.080
I have forty students and then there are five students per group.

110
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.530
And I figured out that group just by looking at the ratio.

111
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.110
For every five students, I have two boys and three girls.

112
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.030
How many groups of five students do I have?

113
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:43.140
So that means that I have eight groups-- forty divided by five --

114
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.720
I have eight groups of five students.

115
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.010
Now we're wondering how many girls there are.

116
00:09:53.020 --> 00:10:07.510
So each group is going to have three girls.

117
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:11.830
So how many girls do I have? I have eight groups, each of them have three girls.

118
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:22.610
So I have 8 groups times 3 girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom.

119
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.000
And you could do the same exercise with boys.

120
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.510
How many boys are there? There's a couple of ways you could do it.

121
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.490
You could say for every group, there are two boys.

122
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.750
There's eight groups. There's sixteen boys.

123
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.490
Or you could say there's forty students. twenty-four of them are girls.

124
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:41.540
forty minus twenty-four is sixteen. So either way you get to sixteen boys.

125
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.520
And if you want to pick up a fast way to do it. It would be identical.

126
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.960
You'd say look, two plus three is five.

127
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.000
For every five students, two boys, three girls.

128
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.460
How many groups are there?

129
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.020
You say forty divided by five is equal to eight groups.

130
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.000
Every group has three girls.

131
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.440
So you do eight times three is equal to twenty-four girls.

132
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.010
Let's do one that's a little bit harder than that.

133
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:21.010
Let's do one where I say that the ratio of -- Let's go back to the farm example.

134
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.570
The ratio of sheep-- I'll do sheep in white.

135
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:40.090
The ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs.

136
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:46.530
The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs-- Maybe I should just say chicken right there.

137
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:51.030
The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs-- Or chickens. I should say chickens.

138
00:11:51.030 --> 00:12:02.010
Is-- Let's say the ratio is two:five:ten.

139
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.030
And notice, I can't reduce this anymore.

140
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.520
There's no number that divides into all of these.

141
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.010
So this is the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs.

142
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:20.330
And let's say that I have a total of fifty-one animals.

143
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:31.850
And I want to know how many chickens do I have.

144
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.470
Well we do the same idea.

145
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.030
For every two sheep, I have five chickens and I have ten pigs.

146
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:45.270
That tells me for every seventeen animals--

147
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:51.030
So every group of seventeen animals, what do I have?

148
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.830
And where did I get seventeen from?

149
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:55.050
I just added two plus five plus ten.

150
00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:01.000
For every seventeen animals, I'm going to have-- Let me pick a new color.

151
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:12.030
I'm going to have two sheep, five chickens, and ten pigs.

152
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.020
Now, how many groups of seventeen animals do I have?

153
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.050
I have a total of fifty-one animals.

154
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.180
So if there's seventeen animals per group,

155
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.740
fifty-one animals divided by seventeen animals per group.

156
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:34.980
I have three groups of seventeen animals.

157
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:40.950
Now I want to know how many chickens. Every group has five chickens.

158
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.530
We already know that. And I have three groups.

159
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.950
So I have three groups. Every group has five chickens.

160
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:54.290
So I'm going to have three times five chickens, which is equal to fifteen chickens.

161
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.760
Not too bad.

162
00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.010
All I did is add these up and say for every seventeen animals, I've got five chickens.

163
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.020
I've got three groups of seventeen.

164
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.020
So for each of those groups, I have five chickens.

165
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:07.570
three times five is fifteen chicken.

166
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:12.060
You could use the same process to figure out the number sheep or pigs you might have.
