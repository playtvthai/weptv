00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:11.730
We are asked to solve the proportion and we have 8/36 = 10/?

2
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.700
Now there is a bunch of different ways to solve this.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.910
And I will explore all of them, not all, only good selection of them.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.010
So one way to think about it is these two need

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.470
to be equivalent fractions.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.000
So whatever happened

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.040
to the numerator also has to happen to the denominator.

8
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.290
So what do you have to multiply 8 by to get 10?

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.300
You could multiply 8  10/8 will definitely give you 10.

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.040
So we're multiplying by 10/8 over here.

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.070
Or another way to write 10/8 is the same thing as 5/4.

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.620
So we're multiplying by 5/4 to get from 8 to 10.

13
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.070
If we did that to the numerator

14
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.020
in order to have an equivalent fraction

15
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.570
you have to do the same thing to the denominator.

16
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.790
You have to multiply it times 5/4.

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.000
And so we can say that this n

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.410
is going to be equal to 36  5/4.

19
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.140
Or you could say that this is going to be equal to

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
365 divided by 4.

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.340
And now 36 divided by 4, we know what that is.

22
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.290
We can divide both the numerator and denominator by 4.

23
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.300
You divide the numerator by 4, you get 9.

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.850
Divide the denominator by 4, you get 1.  You get 45.

25
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.220
So that's one way to think about it.

26
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.760
8/36 = 10/45. Another way to think about it is,

27
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.750
what do we have to multiply 8 by to get its denominator?

28
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.140
How much larger is the denominator 36 than 8?

29
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.360
Let's just divide 36 over 8.

30
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.630
So 36/8 is the same thing as--

31
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.810
so we can simplify,

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.680
dividing the numerator and denominator by 4.

33
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.600
That's their greatest common divisor.

34
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.100
That's the same thing as 9/2.

35
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
If you multiply the numerator by 9/2,

36
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.560
you get the denominator.

37
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.460
Then we'll have to do the same thing over here.

38
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:23.830
If 36 is 9/2 times 8,  let me write this.  8  9/2 = 36.

39
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.910
That's how we go  from the numerator to the denominator.

40
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.950
Then to figure out what the denominator here is,

41
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.950
if we want the same fraction,

42
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.150
we'll have to multiply by 9/2 again.

43
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.920
So then we'll get 10  9/2 = n,

44
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.740
is going to be equal to this denominator.

45
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.230
And so this is the same thing as saying 109 / 2,

46
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.560
divide the numerator and denominator by 2,

47
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.330
you get 5/1 which is 45.  So 45 = n.

48
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.440
Once again we got the same way,

49
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.540
completely legitimate way to solve it.

50
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.230
Now sometimes when you see a proportion like this,

51
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.250
sometimes you'll say oh you could cross multiply.

52
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.870
And you can cross multiply and

53
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.800
I'll teach you how to do that.

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.530
And that's sometimes the quick way to do it.

55
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.430
But I don't like teaching it the first time

56
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.460
you look at proportions

57
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.320
because it's really just something mechanical.

58
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.490
You really don't understand what you're doing

59
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.490
and it really comes out of a little bit of algebra.

60
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.030
And I'll show you the algebra as well.

61
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.800
But if you don't understand it and

62
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.130
if it doesn't make as much sense to you at this point,

63
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.480
don't worry too much about it.

64
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.520
So we have 8/36 = 10/n.

65
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.240
When you cross multiply

66
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.250
you're saying that the numerator here

67
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.170
times the denominator over here is going to be equal to,

68
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.200
so 8n is going to be equal to

69
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.430
the denominator over here--

70
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.650
let me do this in a different colour--

71
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.380
the denominator over here

72
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.240
times the numerator over here.

73
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.000
This is what it means to cross multiply.

74
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.930
So this is going to be equal to 3610.

75
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.280
Or you could say, let me do this in a neutral colour now,

76
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.670
you could say that 8n = 360.

77
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.190
And so you're saying 8 times what is equal to 360.

78
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.470
Or to figure out what that times what is, you divide 360 divided by 8

79
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.020
So we can divide, and this is a little bit of algebra here,

80
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.130
we're dividing both sides of the equation by  8,

81
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.470
and we're getting n= 360/8.

82
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.160
And you know,

83
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.690
you can do that without thinking in strict algebraic terms.

84
00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.810
You say 8 times what is 360?  Well, 8 times 360/8.

85
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:38.050
If I write 8 x ? = 360, well ? could definitely be 360/8.

86
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.580
If I multiply these out,

87
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.730
this guy and that guy cancel out and it's definitely 360.

88
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.070
And that's why it's 360/8.

89
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.780
But then we want to actually divide this

90
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.710
to actually get our right answer or a simplified answer.

91
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.280
8 goes into 360.

92
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.660
8 goes into 36 4 times.  4 times 8 is 32.

93
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.010
You have a remainder of 4.  Bring down the 0.

94
00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.090
8 goes into 40 5 times.  5 times 8 is 40.

95
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.220
And then you have no remainder.  And you're done.

96
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.210
Once again we got n=45.

97
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.020
Now the last way I am going to show you

98
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.000
involves a little bit of algebra.

99
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.820
If any of the ways before this worked, that's fine.

100
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.790
And where this is sitting in the playlist

101
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.320
you're not expected to know the algebra.

102
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.600
But I want to show you the algebra

103
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.670
just because I want to show you

104
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.160
that this cross-multiplication isn't some magic.

105
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.170
That using algebra we will get this exact same thing.

106
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.590
But you could  stop watching this,

107
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.860
if you find this part confusing.

108
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.450
So let's rewrite our proportion.

109
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:42.900
8/36 = 10/n.  And we want to solve for n.

110
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.400
The easiest way to solve for n is maybe multiply both--

111
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.250
this thing on the left is equal to this thing on the right.

112
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.760
So we can multiply them both

113
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.380
by the same thing and the equality will still hold.

114
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.560
So we can multiply both of them by n.

115
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.840
On the right hand side, the n's cancel out.

116
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.390
On the left hand side we have 8/36  n = 10.

117
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.750
Now if we want to solve for n,

118
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.340
we can literally multiply if we want just an n here,

119
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.240
we would want to multiply this side times 36-

120
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.350
I'll do that in a different colour-

121
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.000
we would want to multiply this side times 36 times 8.

122
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.590
Because if you multiply these guys out,

123
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.540
you get 1 and you just have an n.

124
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.230
But since we're doing it to the left hand side,

125
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.930
we also have to do it to the right hand side.

126
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.850
So times 36/8.

127
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:40.490
These guys cancel out and we're left with n= 10  36 is 360/8

128
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.390
And notice we're getting the exact same value

129
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:45.030
that we got with cross multiplying.

130
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.370
And with cross multiplying, you're actually doing 2 steps.

131
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.350
You're actually doing an extra step here.

132
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.320
You're multiplying both sides by n so that you get 8n.

133
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.090
And then you're multiplying both sides

134
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.440
by 36 so that you get your 36 on both sides

135
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.660
and you get this value here.

136
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.270
But at the end when you simplify it,

137
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.110
you'll get the exact same answer.

138
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.960
Those are all different ways to solve this proportion.

139
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.410
Probably the most obvious way

140
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.160
or the easiest way to do it in your head

141
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.150
was either just looking at what you have to multiply the numerator by

142
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.910
and then doing the same thing to the denominator

143
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920
or maybe by cross multiplication.
